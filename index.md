# Hello World!

## Math tests

### Dollars after adding single dollar support and double bracket, so?
#### Inline
Equation $x+y$, so $f(x) = z^3 - \frac{ \sqrt{x} } { \sum_{i = 0}^{n} k_i }$
#### Block
Added support for display math, so

$$\dot{x} = X(x)$$

should render as display...? Maybe adding space?

What aboud double dollar $$\dot{x} = X(x)$$ without lines above and below?


### Bracket, no spaces
#### Inline
Equation \(x+y\) is rendered inline, and
#### Block
Equation \[x+y\] is rendered as display. The problem is that this is achieved with brackets, not dollars, and obsidian does not support brackets.... uff! 


#### Obsidian
Now I opened this as Obsidian vault. Is css changing?
There should be a config yml file at some point...

#### Theme
and the theme changed..? To minima?
